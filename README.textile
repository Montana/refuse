h1. Defer garbage collection to speed up your tests.

Spurned on by a burgeoning test suite, and inspired by "Crank Your Specs":http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/02/02/crank-your-specs/ and "The road to faster tests":http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2742-the-road-to-faster-tests, I've wrapped up the garbage collection hack to make it easy to reuse.

It's a bit of a bandaid solution for now, but it gets the job done.

h2. Usage

h3. Rspec

 In your @spec_helper.rb@:

<pre>config.before(:each) do
  Refuse.disable
end

config.after(:each) do
  Refuse.collect
end</pre>

h3. Cucumber

In @env.rb@:

<pre>Before do
  Refuse.disable
end

After do
  Refuse.collect
end</pre>

h3. Test::Unit

Coming soon!
